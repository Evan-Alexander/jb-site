            <p>I was a restless boy, always on my bike.  Luckily I grew up in Portland, Oregon where such a thing is not only possible, but encouraged.  I enjoyed the freedom my bike provided me.  It was also invigorating. The speed, the wind on my face, the smells, the contstant change in scenery always moving slow enough to take it all in.  It allowed me see things outside of the usual places my parents frequented.  I became curious.  I wanted to know what was around the next corner ... always.  I've carried that sentiment with me to this day.

          <h2>Why do I do this?</h2>
          <p>I've always wanted to program.  However, as mentioned earlier, I was restless.  I tried programming a bit on my old 386 pc, until it crashed on me a number of times.  I put the idea aside for a number of years.  I've had some life events that have happened to me since that have given me newfound perspective and patience.  This combined with the fact that I've always had loads of ideas.  I had an idea for renting full length movies online before Netflix started doing so.  But I've never had the means or capital to do so.  I hope to create and make great things to enrich or simplify everyone's lives.</p>
          <p>I wound up at Epicodus in a serendipitous way.  I've had a number of different jobs throughout my life.  One would think that diversity in work experience would provide perspective and development of problem solving skills.  I've cooked professionally for over 13 years.  I have a bachelor's degree in history.  I have project management experience working for the biggest post production company in the world, Deluxe.  I taught English in South Korea for two years.  I gave bicycle tours for a number of years.  Alas, in early 2016, I couldn't find a job in Portland.</p>
          <p>My buddy Milos, owned a small startup that developed an app called SpaceView.  It was an augmented reality app that helped with interior design.  He hired me on to help with business development and marketing, both of which I knew little about.  I loved working at SpaceView.  It was the first time I worked in an environment where I felt supported to learn, experiment, have ideas and present them in a welcoming environment, and I wore so many different "hats".  It was toughest job I ever had.  Everyone was so busy, they had little to no time to show me things or answer questions.  I had to figure it out for myself. At first this element was a bit frustrating.  Then I got used to it.  Then I really enjoyed it.  It felt empowering.  One of the developers and I got to talking and she thought I would enjoy coding.  She had a boyfriend that went to Epicodus and right out of school was hired at Nike.</p>
          <p>A few weeks later SpaceView ran out of funding and I was laid off.  I worked there for all of three months.  But it forever changed my attitude regarding work.  While applying for new jobs, I signed up for online coding classes via <a class="treehouse" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/"></a>TeamTreehouse.com.  I fell in love with coding.  I spent the next three months practicing, taking notes, and cursing at my computer.  But this time around I had patience.  I had the tenacity for learning I developed while at University, teaching abroad, and at SpaceView.  This all leads me to you reading this right now.  You're still reading!  I'm excited for this new journey.  I have a passion for this like I wished I had with cooking.</p>
